## About the Game

This is a classic memory game \(a.k.a "concentration"\). The Player \(You\) wins if all the cards are matched. You will be awarded 3, 2 or 1 star depending how many moves you make. The time is not rated for now \(we\'re not that harsh, but beware! - we\'ll add this feature later ;\) \)


## Installation

To install the game clone this repo and open index.html in your browser.


## Instructions

As you click the very first card the timer goes on and your clicks \(here called moves\). Be quick! Flip a card. Flip another card. If they match they will turn green. If not - they will turn red for about a sec and then flip back. After you match \'em all you will see a panel with your score and time you played. You\'ll be of course be able to play again and again and again and...  

Feature: every time you start a new game the deck turns its color!

If you\'re not pleased with the deck\'s color or just want a fresh start - you can hit the Restart button and enjoy a new game.
